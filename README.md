# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game

This is my first student project in Python, built as part of the JavaRush course. It's a simple, console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
2.  Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3.  Run the game from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
